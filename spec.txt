create a Python Function Server, a FastAPI-based service (uvicorn) that: 1) maintains a collection of Python functions (code), 2) installs packages/dependencies, 3) runs functions via API (with function arguments), 4) allows functions to depend on other functions within the server.  The project should be well-structured Python project with unit tests, administrative endpoints (to query, CRUD functions, collect statistics), logging, Docker container, and be a Git repository)
